/* Write a function to decode a given input string.
Each letter is paired with the letter that it coincides with when the alphabet is reversed.
For example: "a" is encoded with "z", "b" with "y", "c" with "x", etc
Spaces are not encoded/decoded. For example: "gsrh nvhhztv" will be decoded as "this message"
