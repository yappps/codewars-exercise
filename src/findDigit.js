/* 
The function findDigit takes two numbers as input, num and nth. It outputs the nth digit of num (counting from right to left).

#Note

If num is negative, ignore its sign and treat it as a positive value.
If nth is not positive, return -1.
Keep in mind that 42 = 00042. This means that findDigit(42, 5) would return 0.
